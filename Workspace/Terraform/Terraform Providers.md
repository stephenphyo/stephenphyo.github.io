##### Providers can be written by individuals

- Any person or organization can develop and distribute a Terraform provider, allowing them to expand Terraform's capabilities to manage resources.

##### Providers can be maintained by a community of users

- Many Terraform providers are open source projects, and the development and maintenance of these providers can be collaborative efforts between multiple individuals and organizations.

##### Some providers are maintained by HashiCorp

- HashiCorp maintains a number of official providers that cover popular infrastructure providers such as AWS, Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.

##### Major cloud vendors and non-cloud vendors can write, maintain, or collaborate on Terraform providers

- Providers can be developed and maintained by cloud vendors, non-cloud vendors, or a combination of both, to expand Terraform's capabilities and support for different types of infrastructure.
